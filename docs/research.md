During my sophomore and junior years, I participated in multiple research projects under the remote guidance of [Prof. Lina Zhou](https://belkcollege.charlotte.edu/directory/lina-zhou) and her PhD fellows in UNC Charlotte KAIM Research Group. Our fields of research involves Sentiment Analysis, Misinformation Detection, Multimodal Learning and so on. To be specific, there are 3 topics as follows:

   1. Predict the results of content moderation on Reddit with the RoBERTa model and analyze the impact of multi-type, multi-level user engagement characteristics on model performance.
   2. Apply deep learning methods of natural language understanding to analyze the public's attitudes and sentiments towards different trending topics on social media in the post-pandemic era.
   3. Leverage short video data to build a multi-task, multi-modal artificial intelligence system for analyzing the influence of different video features on the sales of Tiktok e-commerce products.

   Until now, one conference paper we co-writed has been published while the others are under review.

   and Efficiency of User Engagement. _CCCIS Proceedings_ (pp. 1-6).

   This experience has gained me a lot of insights into the modern research process and the importance of teamwork.

Since 2022 fall semester, I have been supervised by [Prof. Yongjun Li](http://bs.ustc.edu.cn/English/profile-70.html) to work on a student innovation program with the topic "Dynamic Pricing Optimization Considering Learning Behavior in the Context of Big Data". Although the program is still on progress, I have learned a lot about the application of Bayesian models in econometrics.
